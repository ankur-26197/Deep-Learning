# Deep-Learning
The repository contains several assignments completed during learning and exploration phase of Deep Learning. Starting from the basic simple neuron models to complex deep networks
have been implemented. Many are implemented from scratch without using libraries to appreciate the concepts in a better way. Anyone who is in the learning phase in DL will find
these useful.
